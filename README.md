Credit Card Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning
=============================================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the implementation of unsupervised learning techniques for customer segmentation using the "Credit Card Dataset". The project aims to analyze the usage behavior of credit card holders and identify meaningful clusters to improve targeted marketing strategies.

Project Details
---------------

Explore different clustering strategies (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, SOM, Hierarchical clustering) to obtain consistent groups of customers. Determine the appropriate value of "k" for clustering. The dataset includes 18 behavioral variables for approximately 9,000 active credit card holders over 6 months.
